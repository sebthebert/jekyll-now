title: Blog as Code
---

I wanted to Blog as Code (BaC).
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) was too complicated, [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com) was just what I was looking for:

  * Markdown syntax
  * 'Commit & Push' (or create/edit a file directly on github.com) to publish a post
  * Drafts in a branch
